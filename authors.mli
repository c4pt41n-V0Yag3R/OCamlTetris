   Academic Integrity Statement

   All work in this assignment is entirely our own.

   There is one algorithm that is 10 loc that is based on a randomization 
   algorithm developed by Donald Knuth. The code was adapted from some code 
   on the OCaml discussion board. This is acknowledged in a comment before
   that function with a link to the discussion post.
